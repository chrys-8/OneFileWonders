# OneFileWonders
Random collection of one-file programs in C++ to explore an idea and to provide me with inspiration further down the line.

## glob.cpp
Inspired by a tsoding livestream, I implemented glob in C++. Build with C++20 features enabled.

## binary_heap.cpp
My implementation of the binary heap through a functional-style interface that only uses type constraints on ranges. Build with C++20 features enabled.
Doesn't have rigorous testing and is intended more as a demonstration of ranges and constraints in C++20.
